Hello dev...

=/= This is "My card" Flutter app. It looks like a business card with the main informations: 
* Photo
* Full Name
* Job
* Phone number
* Email adress
* LinkedIn adress
* Facebook adress
* (optional) The website of the person


=/= I made it different than the ordinary buisiness card by adding some interactivity with the users. They can:
* call the person when they touch his phone number (1st card)
* Send sms to the person when they touch his phone number (2nd card)
* Send emails to the person when they touch his email 
* Go to the LinkedIn profile page when they tap the correspondet button
* Go to the Facebook profile page when they tap the correspondet button
* Go to the personal website when they tap the correspondet button (optional)

=/= I used two external packages which are: 
* google_fonts: ^0.4.0, for text styles
* url_launcher: ^5.4.2, for the operations of launching urls, make calls, send sms and emails
